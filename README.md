The provided C code implements a simple file system simulator that allows users to interactively create, delete, list, read, and write files within a directory. It uses in-memory structures to represent directories and files. The program utilizes the FILE object from the standard library for more realistic file operations, enabling users to perform actions on actual files on disk. The interactive command-line interface prompts users to enter commands such as create_file, delete_file, list_files, read_file, write_file, and exit, providing a basic yet functional file system simulation.
